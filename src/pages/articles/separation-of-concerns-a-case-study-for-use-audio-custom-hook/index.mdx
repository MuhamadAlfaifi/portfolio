## Preface

In the vast ocean of programming, design patterns serve as lighthouses guiding developers towards cleaner, more efficient code. Among these, the principle of 
separation of concerns (SoC) stands as a cornerstone, urging us to compartmentalize our code into distinct sections each handling a specific aspect 
of the functionality. This not only enhances code readability but significantly eases the process of debugging, testing, 
and scaling our applications. Through a case study of rewriting an open-source `useAudio()`[^1] hook, this article illuminates the pivotal 
role of SoC in preparing our codebase to accommodate changes, especially in the frontend landscape prone to frequent shifts in requirements and technology.


## Separation of Concerns: Preparing for Rewrites

Every line of code we write today is a candidate for a rewrite tomorrow. As the requirements evolve, so must our code. However, the ease with which 
we can adapt to these changes is heavily influenced by how well-separated our concerns are. 

In the context of our `useAudio()`[^1] hook, it intertwined the core audio handling logic with the React hook logic. While functional, this 
amalgamation made the hook less flexible to changes and more difficult to extend or reuse in different contexts.

```javascript
// Initial useAudio hook
export const useAudio = (/* ... */) => { /* intertwined core logic and React logic */ }
```


## Frontend Change: An Inevitable Reality

In the frontend realm, changes are more of a rule than an exception. New business requirements, user feedback, or technology upgrades often demand us 
to revisit and revise our code. Preparing for such inevitabilities is prudent. By separating the core logic from the framework or 
library-specific logic, we build a solid foundation that can withstand the winds of change with grace.


### Initial Version [^1]

The initial version of the useAudio hook encapsulated both the core audio handling logic and the React-specific logic within a single function. 
This entanglement made it harder to identify, isolate, and modify specific behaviors.

```javascript
// Initial useAudio hook
export const useAudio = (/* ... */) => { /* intertwined core logic and React logic */ }
```


### Rewritten Version [^2]

In the rewritten version, the core audio handling logic is encapsulated within a dedicated Audio class. The useAudio hook then serves as 
a bridge, connecting this core logic to the React ecosystem. This separation facilitates a clear understanding of what each part of the code 
is responsible for, and where to look when changes are required.

```javascript
// The Audio class encapsulates core audio handling logic
export class Audio {
  // ...

  get state() {
    return {
      // ...
      currentTime: this.audio.currentTime,
      duration: this.audio.duration,
      // ...
    };
  }

  subscribe(listener: TAudioListener) {
    const _listener = () => listener(this.audio.state);

    this.audio.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', _listener);
    this.audio.addEventListener('timeupdate', _listener);

    return () => {
      this.audio.removeEventListener('loadedmetadata', _listener);
      this.audio.removeEventListener('timeupdate', _listener);
    };
  }
}

// The useAudio hook subscribes to the instance and update its state
function useAudio(src: string, options: Partial<TAudioOptions> = {}) {
  const [audio, setAudio] = useState(getInstance({ src, ...options } as TAudioOptions));
  const [state, setState] = useState<TAudioState>(audio.state);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!audio) {
      setAudio(getInstance({ src, ...options } as TAudioOptions));
    }

    const unsubscribe = audio.subscribe((state: TAudioState) => startTransition(() =>
      setState(state)
    ));

    return unsubscribe;
  }, [audio]);

  return [state, audio.controls];
}
```


### Benefits Reaped

By separating concerns, the rewritten version of the useAudio hook brings several benefits to the table:

**Ease of Modification:** With a clear boundary between the core audio logic and the React integration, making modifications or extending functionality becomes a straightforward task.

**Reusability:** The Audio class can be reused across different projects, whether they use React or not, promoting code reusability.

**Testing:** Testing becomes more manageable as we can test the core audio logic independently from the React integration.

**Readability:** The code becomes more readable and understandable, fostering a conducive environment for collaboration and maintenance.
