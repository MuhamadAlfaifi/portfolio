## What is Nextjs 14?

Nextjs is a framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) React applications. 
It is a great framework that provides a lot of features out of the box. It is also very easy to use and get started with. 
It is a great choice for building a React application that needs to be server-side rendered.

## What is Spring Boot Security?

Spring Security is a framework that focuses on providing both authentication and authorization to Java applications.

## The Problem?

When integrating Nextjs 14 with Rest Java Rest API, you will face a problem with the authentication process. leaving you to implement your own 
authentication process or use a third-party library like next-auth.

The default authentication for java applications uses cookies to store the session id and a login form.

Rest APIs done this way will leave you with a problem of how to use nextjs framework with it.

## The Solution?

The solution is to use the same session that is created by Spring Security in Nextjs 14.

## How to do it?

First, you need to clone the the following template [https://github.com/MuhamadAlfaifi/nextjs-springboot-auth](https://github.com/MuhamadAlfaifi/nextjs-springboot-auth)

Then, create a `.env` enviroment file in the root of the project and add the following variable

```bash
SPRING_BOOT_HOST=http://localhost:8080
```

Thats it! ðŸŽ‰  Customize the login form in `src/(api)/login/page.tsx` using tailwind classes and you are good to go.

Now, from server components you will get automatic redirection to /login route and protection if you fetched the rest api using `api()` function.

for example, if you want to fetch the user profile from the rest api, you can do the following

```tsx
'use server';

import { api } from '@/(api)/api'

export default async function MyServerComponent() {
  const user = await api('/user/profile')
  
  return <div>{user.name}</div>
}
```
